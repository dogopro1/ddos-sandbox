# DDoS Test Page and Attack Scripts

This project includes a local test page simulating a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack and several attack scripts that can be used to perform stress tests or security evaluations on a server. The project consists of both frontend (HTML) and backend (scripts) components for testing purposes.

### Folder: `attack-scripts/`

This folder contains various scripts that launch different types of attacks and manage a local server.

- **`attack_test.sh`**: A shell script that uses `hping3` to perform a SYN flood attack on a target IP/URL. It simulates a high-traffic environment by continuously sending packets to the target.

  **Usage:**
  ```bash
  ./attack_test.sh <target> <port>
start_apache.sh: A shell script to build and run an Apache HTTP server in a Docker container. This server serves the index.html page from the public-html folder. It's useful for quickly setting up a test environment for DDoS simulations.

Usage:

Bash

./start_apache.sh
pythonFile.py: A Python script that continuously sends HTTP GET requests to a target URL and prints the HTTP status codes. It simulates a simple form of an HTTP flood attack by making multiple requests to the server.

Usage:

Bash

python3 pythonFile.py <target_url>
ddos_attack_script.py: A Python script that simulates a SYN flood attack using scapy. This script allows you to configure the target IP, port, packet size, and the number of packets to send.

Usage:

Bash

python3 ddos_attack_script.py -t <target_ip> -p <port> -s <packet_size> -c <packet_count>
reqFile.py: A Python script that launches multiple threads to send HTTP GET requests to a target URL. The script sends requests as fast as possible, simulating high traffic. It does not wait for responses, making it useful for simple flooding attacks.

Usage:

Bash

python3 reqFile.py <target_url> <num_threads>
Folder: public-html/
This folder contains the index.html file, which is served by the Apache server. The HTML page is a simple web page with a button to reload the page, simulating a target under attack.

index.html: A basic HTML page with a button labeled "Attack Me". Clicking the button refreshes the page, allowing for easy manual checking of server responsiveness during tests.
Folder: logs/
This folder is intended to store any logs generated by the attack scripts, which can be useful for monitoring and analysis.

Dockerfile
This file contains the instructions for building a Docker image for the Apache HTTP server that serves the index.html page.

Docker Setup
To easily run the test web page locally, this project provides a Docker configuration.

Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine.

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ddos-test-page.git](https://github.com/your-username/ddos-test-page.git)
cd ddos-test-page/ddos-sandbox
Step 2: Build the Docker Image

Build the Docker image for the Apache server.

Bash

docker build -t ddos-apache .
Step 3: Start the Apache Server

To start the server and make it accessible at http://localhost:8080, run the following command:

Bash

docker run -d -p 8080:80 ddos-apache
Step 4: Test the DDoS Page

Open http://localhost:8080/ in your web browser. You should see a simple webpage with a button labeled "Attack Me". Clicking this button will reload the page.

Step 5: Perform a DDoS Attack

To perform an attack on your local test server, you can use the provided scripts in the attack-scripts directory. Make sure your Docker container is running before launching the attacks.

Basic HTTP Flood (via pythonFile.py):

Bash

cd attack-scripts
python3 pythonFile.py http://localhost:8080/
SYN Flood (via ddos_attack_script.py):

Bash

cd attack-scripts
python3 ddos_attack_script.py -t 127.0.0.1 -p 8080 -s 64 -c 10000
Simple HTTP Flood (via reqFile.py with multiple threads):

Bash

cd attack-scripts
python3 reqFile.py http://localhost:8080/ 10
SYN Flood (via attack_test.sh using hping3):

Bash

cd attack-scripts
./attack_test.sh 127.0.0.1 8080
Important Notes:

Ethical Use: This project is intended solely for local testing and educational purposes. Do not use it on production environments or websites without proper authorization. Performing DDoS attacks on unauthorized systems is illegal and unethical.
Dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary tools installed on your system:
hping3: For the SYN flood attack in attack_test.sh. Install using your distribution's package manager (e.g., sudo apt-get install hping3 on Debian/Ubuntu, sudo yum install hping3 on CentOS/RHEL).
