# DDoS Test Page and Attack Scripts

This project includes a local test page simulating a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack and several attack scripts that can be used to perform stress tests or security evaluations on a server. The project consists of both frontend (HTML) and backend (scripts) components for testing purposes.

## Folder: `attack-scripts/`

This folder contains various scripts that launch different types of attacks and manage a local server.

### `attack_test.sh`

A shell script that uses `hping3` to perform a SYN flood attack on a target IP/URL. It simulates a high-traffic environment by continuously sending packets to the target.


```bash
./attack_test.sh <target> <port>

start_apache.sh
A shell script to build and run an Apache HTTP server in a Docker container. This server serves the index.html page from the public-html folder. It's useful for quickly setting up a test environment for DDoS simulations.
./start_apache.sh

pythonFile.py
A Python script that continuously sends HTTP GET requests to a target URL and prints the HTTP status codes. It simulates a simple form of an HTTP flood attack by making multiple requests to the server.
python3 pythonFile.py <target_url>

ddos_attack_script.py
A Python script that simulates a SYN flood attack using scapy. This script allows you to configure the target IP, port, packet size, and the number of packets to send.
python3 ddos_attack_script.py -t <target_ip> -p <port> -s <packet_size> -c <packet_count>

reqFile.py
A multithreaded Python script for simple HTTP flood attacks.
python3 reqFile.py <target_url> <num_threads>

public-html/
This folder contains the index.html file, which is served by the Apache server. The HTML page is a simple web page with a button to reload the page, simulating a target under attack.

index.html
A basic HTML page with a button labeled "Attack Me". Clicking the button refreshes the page, allowing for easy manual checking of server responsiveness during tests.


logs/
This folder is intended to store any logs generated by the attack scripts, which can be useful for monitoring and analysis.


Dockerfile
This file contains the instructions for building a Docker image for the Apache HTTP server that serves the index.html page.

Docker Setup
To easily run the test web page locally using Docker:

Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/dogopro1/ddos-sandbox]
cd ddos-test-page/ddos-sandbox

Build the Docker Image
docker build -t ddos-apache .

Start the Apache Server
docker run -d -p 8080:80 ddos-apache

Test the DDoS Page
Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
